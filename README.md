# DL-keras-tensorflow-projects
making some projects public - some for coursework, some for fun.

Recent ones (2020)
1. Multi-layer perception - [word prediction](https://github.com/gabrielle-ong/DL-keras-tensorflow-projects/blob/master/Word%20prediction.ipynb) given a sequence
2. CNN: [is this a pair of shoes?](https://github.com/gabrielle-ong/DL-keras-tensorflow-projects/blob/master/CNN%20are%20shoes%20a%20pair.ipynb)
3. RNN, Autoencoder: [news headlines generator](https://github.com/gabrielle-ong/DL-keras-tensorflow-projects/blob/master/news%20headline%20generator.ipynb). Currently just generates the same headline, but can be extended to have text as input, headline as output
4. (Exploratory fun) Music Chord detection. [Audio analysis](https://github.com/gabrielle-ong/DL-keras-tensorflow-projects/blob/master/Chord%20Detection%20feature%20analysis.ipynb) to extract frequencies and notes, built as a custom layer to [train a model](https://github.com/gabrielle-ong/DL-keras-tensorflow-projects/blob/master/Chord%20Detection%20model%20training.ipynb). Theoretically chord detection can be done via math eg fourier transform. But my application is band music with multiple instruments, improvisations and jazzy overtones. Hence tried to combine mathematical feature extraction and ML, resulting in much headache.
